This is my personal editor, and this my first project by react.I am a primary frontend, if someone is
interested in it, I'd hope you can share with your advice.

task list:
5. function: drag, bold, import img, import link.

6. selection.

7. command + z(I want to use array to record every text list and cursor).

8. double click to select word.

9. toggle text list to view.

current task:
1. use algorithm to improve optimization.
2. drag.
3. delete and backspace(when reduce line or add line)

I am using mac to code this editor, so maybe it will have some bug in windows(option and command function):
current function list:
1. arrowleft, arrowright, arrowup, arrowdown to move caret.
2. ctrl + arrow to move caret(word), command + arrow to move caret(line).
3. option + delete/backspace to delete word, command to line.
4. click editor to check cursor.
5. drog is pending...
